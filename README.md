## Description

In this project we have trained a model in order to classify handwritten images within a given categories. We have used this model to predict the category of some new entries drawn in the Paint application.  In this essay we will focus on the main CRISP-CM methodology steps that were taken into account when developing the project, while showing and explaining the obtained results.
