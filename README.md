## Description

In this project we have trained a model in order to classify handwritten images within a given categories. In this essay we will focus on the main CRISP-CM methodology steps that were taken into account when developing the project, while showing and explaining the obtained results.

## Repository desctiption
The repository is devided in four deliveries, following the course structure:
* In [FirstDelivery](https://github.com/oriolborrellroig/ADM-Deliveries/tree/master/FirstDelivery) we created the basis of the project. We prepared the preprocessing script, applied some visualization techniques, and build a KNN classifier for two categories.
* In [SecondDelivery](https://github.com/oriolborrellroig/ADM-Deliveries/tree/master/SecondDelivery) we updated the preprocessing script of the last deliverable to be able to deal with 5 categories. We also built a CNN classifier and compared the results with the ones previously obtained with the KNN classifier.
* In [ThirdDelivery]()
* In [FourthDelivery]()

Each delivery folder contains an explanation of the files that are included.

## The Data

The data used in the project is obtained from the [Google Cloud Platform](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/quickdraw_dataset/full/raw).
